By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\n\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean.",

			"Founded in 1795 and passed down through one family for the past seven generations, Jim Beam is the world's best-selling bourbon. From Tokyo to London to Louisville, Jim Beam sets the benchmark for what a bourbon should be, aged twice as long as required by law for a flavor that's unlike any other. Distilled with corn, malted barley, time, pride and passion, there's a reason why Jim Beam Bourbon is on almost every bar shelf. However, it isn't the name that should entice you. Opening a bottle is the best way to celebrate life events, gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. It's as versatile as it is smooth, something you've probably always aspired to be, yet it does so effortlessly.\n\nTo get the distinct flavor of Jim Beam Bourbon, the distillery ages the liquor in charred oak barrels for a minimum of four years. This imparts a medium body and a caramel color that you've come to know in a bourbon. The oaky, vanilla and spicy backdrop greets you with a swirling of the bourbon, inviting you to taste what lies within the glass. When you finally raise the glass, your taste buds become overwhelmed with a five-pronged attack of sweetness, grain, oak, char and fruit. Most five-pronged attacks are best left to the battlefield or sporting event, but this bludgeons you over the head with flavors that keep you coming back. Enjoy Jim Beam Bourbon on the rocks, with a splash of water or in one of your favorite cocktails.\nBeam Suntory",

However, when it comes to enjoying Cognac, we haven’t followed any rules since 1765.\n\nCreated in 1870 by Maurice Hennessy for his circle of close friends, Hennessy X.O was the first “Extra Old” Cognac ever invented and established the category. In 1947, Gérald de Geoffre designed the first Hennessy X.O decanter, whose distinctive form is still familiar to us today. Its silhouette is a tribute to the pyramid-like forms of the grape bunches that give birth to the Cognac eaux-de-vie.\n\nHennessy X.O's intense and deep amber color is a sign of its strength. Its flavors of candied fruit and its subtle and lightly spicy nose create a complete harmony: a mark of its power and roundness. To taste, a smooth, full sensation gives a simultaneously powerful and soft tonality with a hint of cocoa and a warm, fruity presence. The long finish expresses all the complexity of the cognac’s blending and its long ageing process.\n\nBest enjoyed neat, on the rocks, or with a splash of soda water.",

			"Bacardi Superior is Bacardi's flagship rum and the one that started it all way back in 1862. In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\n\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean.",

			"Proudly touted as \"a most unusual gin,\" Hendrick's Gin is a delightfully curious liquid with a unique character that stands out from the rest. This small-batch gin is produced by William Grant & Sons and infused with cucumber, rose and traditional juniper at the brand's Scottish distillery. Small batches are typically defined as 1,000 liters or fewer, but Hendrick's Gin is crafted in tiny 500-liter batches, giving the master distiller more control over her artistry.\n\nHendrick's is the result of combining two different spirits from rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. The exceptionally smooth gin features a nice balance of subtle flavors, which include wonderful notes of flowers, fruits, roots and seeds from across the world. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick's as the \"Best Gin in the World.\"\n\nWilliam Grant & Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\n\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets. Gordon's Cup is a sour-and-salty concoction that marries cucumber, salt and pepper, lime juice and freshly ground salt and pepper. If that's too ambitious, try a simple Gin & Tonic using Hendrick's.\n\nBuy Hendrick’s Gin online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick up in store.",

The scents are lifted by lingering rose petal and violet aromas, while deeper notes of graphite, leather, and pipe tobacco bring depth. On the palate, the wine echoes the initial aromatics with juicy flavors of blue and red fruits and hints of secondary flavors like chocolate malt, dulce de leche, coffee and a bit of earthiness. As the wine continues across the palate, it grows in breadth and richness with a density and concentration that is impressive. Supple tannins and refreshing acidity give shape and structure to the weight of the fruit harmonizing nicely and leading to a long finish ending on flavors of blue fruits and spice.

Does that matter? Not when it tastes this good. Oh, and it's a great price, too. Pinnacle Vodka is a great everyday spirit for your home bar. It's tasty and infinitely mixable.\n\nHow can you mix it? Any way you want, but start with a classic lemon drop. Stick to this formula: Add sour and sweet to spirit. The spirit is the vodka. For sour you have lemons. Your sweet is in the form of granulated sugar, cubes or simple syrup. Smash the lemons; then shake them with vodka, sweetener and ice. Strain that into a sugar-rimmed martini glass. Bang.\n\nGot it? Now let's twist it up. Substitute half of the lemons for tangerines. Swap the simple syrup for peach schnapps. Serve the drink on the rocks in a big mug with soda. Or try one of Pinnacle's many flavors like Whipped or Kiwi Strawberry. Stick to the sour/sweet/spirit formula and do it your way.\n\nBuy Pinnacle Original Flavored Vodka online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\n\nWinner of Gold Medal & Best Buy at the 2017 BTI",

Its natural smoky flavor is derived by cooking the maguey in a conical stone oven on mesquite and ocote, woods native to Oaxaca.  The cooked maguey is then tahona-mashed, fermented naturally in open-air pine vats, and double-distilled over a wood fire.\n\nThe pure appearance and substantial body result from age old methods used in the production process.  The finished aroma is natural and robust; a combination of maguey, mesquite and ocote.  Earthy characteristics on the front palate give way to citrus and rich vegetal maguey notes that finish distinctively clean. A tinge of smoke complements these qualities without overwhelming the delicate balance found in Xicaru.  \n",

Upon tasting the special blend, Joseph insisted that the family blend be put on the market. It went on to become one Seagram's biggest sellers.",

Using crystal clear Canadian water, plus the finest rye, grains, and corn, the whisky is painstakingly distilled, Blended at Birth™, and put up in premium oak barrels to gently mature. The result is an uncompressed flavor with steadfast popularity. Aged for 8 years, this medium-bodied whisky delights with a mix of nutty, malty, and spice notes. ",

			"Founded in 1795 and passed down through one family for the past seven generations, Jim Beam is the world's best-selling bourbon. From Tokyo to London to Louisville, Jim Beam sets the benchmark for what a bourbon should be, aged twice as long as required by law for a flavor that's unlike any other. Distilled with corn, malted barley, time, pride and passion, there's a reason why Jim Beam Bourbon is on almost every bar shelf. However, it isn't the name that should entice you. Opening a bottle is the best way to celebrate life events, gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. It's as versatile as it is smooth, something you've probably always aspired to be, yet it does so effortlessly.\n\nTo get the distinct flavor of Jim Beam Bourbon, the distillery ages the liquor in charred oak barrels for a minimum of four years. This imparts a medium body and a caramel color that you've come to know in a bourbon. The oaky, vanilla and spicy backdrop greets you with a swirling of the bourbon, inviting you to taste what lies within the glass. When you finally raise the glass, your taste buds become overwhelmed with a five-pronged attack of sweetness, grain, oak, char and fruit. Most five-pronged attacks are best left to the battlefield or sporting event, but this bludgeons you over the head with flavors that keep you coming back. Enjoy Jim Beam Bourbon on the rocks, with a splash of water or in one of your favorite cocktails.\nBeam Suntory",

			"Bacardi Superior is Bacardi's flagship rum and the one that started it all way back in 1862. In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\n\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean.",

Founded in 1783 on the banks of the Ohio River, Evan Williams is one of the oldest distilleries in the country and the first bourbon distillery in Kentucky. Because of its history and secret recipe, Evan Williams Black Label is the premier Kentucky bourbon to suit your tastes.\n\nAs soon as you open a bottle of Evan Williams Black Label, you're met with a rich aroma of vanilla and mint, but this is just the precursor. When it hits your lips, hints of oak, caramel and brown sugar greet you and linger through the satisfying finish.\n\nAlthough purists say the only way to drink bourbon is neat or on the rocks, Evan Williams Black Label lends itself to any number of lavish cocktails. Evan and cola is an all-American choice among cocktails, while an Evan and mineral water brightens the flavor without any harshness.\n\nIf you're into something that introduces more flavors, a classic mint julep or Manhattan transports you to the Kentucky Derby or the Big Apple, that is unless you already live in one of these cities. If not, experiment on your own with juices, sodas and mixers, and name it after your hometown. With any luck, a Des Moines Fury will catch on like wildfire. Evan Williams Black Label lets you show off your creativity behind the bar.\n\nBuy Evan Williams Black online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

After harvest, the agave piñas are roasted in traditional brick ovens for 72 hours, before undergoing an extra-slow fermentation process over an additional eighty hours, nearly double the industry standard. \n\nCasamigos Blanco Tequila rests for 2 months and is crisp and clean with hints of citrus, vanilla and sweet agave, with a long smooth finish.\n\nCasamigos Blanco is best served neat on the rocks or as a perfect base for cocktails such as the classic margarita. To make simply mix 2 oz Casamigos Blanco Tequila, 1 oz fresh lime juice, .25 oz fresh orange juice, .5 oz agave nectar, and .5 oz orange liqueur of your choice in a shaker. Add ice, shake vigorously and then strain into a rocks glass.

			"When only a tried-and-true dry gin will do, turn to Beefeater London Dry Gin. The gin's recipe dates to 1863 and has stood the test of time, becoming the most award-winning gin over the last decade. Bottled at 40 percent alcohol by volume, Beefeater London boasts maximum flavor in every bottle. You will adore the spiced, fruity notes that make Beefeater comparable to more premium brands, only you'll save a fortune when stocking the liquor cabinet!\n\nNamed after the Tower of London ceremonial guards, Beefeater Gin is bottled and distributed by the company James Burrough in the United Kingdom. The Beefeater distillery is one of only nine still operating in London itself. Beefeater London Dry Gin contains a lovely array of botanicals, including angelica root and seeds, juniper, coriander seeds, almonds, licorice, Seville oranges, lemon peel and orris root. The production process involves steeping these botanicals for a full 24 hours before distillation to fully extract the flavors.\n\nThe best way to enjoy Beefeater London's flavors is to sip it straight. It's a dry gin with a wonderful herbal bouquet and a citrus back. If you prefer your gin mixed in cocktails, infuse it with a sweet vermouth or use it in a classic gin and tonic. Try mixing a Gin St. Clements, which is Beefeater dry gin, fresh orange and lemon juice and tonic.\n\nBuy Beefeater Gin online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

			"Maker's Mark started with bread, of course. Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable – just not in a predictable way.\n\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\n\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

Using crystal clear Canadian water, plus the finest rye, grains, and corn, the whisky is painstakingly distilled, Blended at Birth™, and put up in premium oak barrels to gently mature. The result is an uncompressed flavor with steadfast popularity. Aged for 3 years, Black Velvet is a remarkably smooth, medium bodied whisky with hints of caramel, vanilla, coconut, and rye.",

He became the first to export tequila to the rest of the world, and today, Sauza offers a full line of tequila. Sauza® Silver, one of the pioneer spirits from the brand, is double distilled in copper pot stills at low proof to retain the full agave flavor.

Originally a celebratory drink for hunters (hence the \"jäger\"), it's the ideal drink to mark every big win — or even a well-deserved weekend. Jäger is 70 proof, so you know this liqueur means business.\n\nA true classic, the Jägermeister recipe hasn't changed since it was first made in 1878 in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. This dark-colored liqueur is made with 56 different herbs and spices, including licorice, anise, ginger, juniper berries and citrus peel. The herb and spice blend is steeped in water and alcohol, and its aged in oak barrels for a year. Then it's mixed with sugar and alcohol before it's bottled and shipped right to your front door.\n\nEven the Jägermeister bottle is custom. As the story goes, distiller Curt Mast and his buddies spent a lot of time hunting and needed a bottle that could stand up to their outdoorsy lifestyle. Mast did what anyone would do and dropped a bunch of bottles on the floor until he found a shape that held up to his tests.\n\nThe easiest way to enjoy Jägermeister is in the form of an ice-cold shot, preferably chilled to zero degrees. But if you're more of a cocktail fan, try a Jäger Tonic with tonic water, citrus zest and ice.\n\nBuy Jägermeister online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door.",

			"Dark, bold and packed with intense flavor, Jägermeister is unlike any liqueur you've ever sipped before. Originally a celebratory drink for hunters (hence the \"jäger\"), it's the ideal drink to mark every big win — or even a well-deserved weekend. Jäger is 70 proof, so you know this liqueur means business.\n\nA true classic, the Jägermeister recipe hasn't changed since it was first made in 1878 in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. This dark-colored liqueur is made with 56 different herbs and spices, including licorice, anise, ginger, juniper berries and citrus peel. The herb and spice blend is steeped in water and alcohol, and its aged in oak barrels for a year. Then it's mixed with sugar and alcohol before it's bottled and shipped right to your front door.\n\nEven the Jägermeister bottle is custom. As the story goes, distiller Curt Mast and his buddies spent a lot of time hunting and needed a bottle that could stand up to their outdoorsy lifestyle. Mast did what anyone would do and dropped a bunch of bottles on the floor until he found a shape that held up to his tests.\n\nThe easiest way to enjoy Jägermeister is in the form of an ice-cold shot, preferably chilled to zero degrees. But if you're more of a cocktail fan, try a Jäger Tonic with tonic water, citrus zest and ice.\n\nBuy Jägermeister online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door.",

Due to its especially high rye content, Bulleit Bourbon has a bold, spicy character with a finish that's distinctively clean and smooth. Medium amber in color, with gentle spiciness and sweet oak aromas, the mid-palate is smooth with tones of maple, oak, and nutmeg. The finish is long, dry, and satiny with a light-tasting toffee flavor that lingers long after the final sip. Simply combine our bourbon whiskey with cloves, lemon juice, brown sugar and hot water for a comforting Hot Toddy.  Bulleit Bourbon is still distilled and aged in the Bulleit family tradition. High rye content gives it a bold, spicy character with a distinctively smooth, clean finish. Kentucky limestone-filtered water provides a foundation for the bourbon's character, while charred American oak barrels lend a smoky backbone. Please drink responsibly.",

			"Longtime friends George Clooney, Rande Gerber and Mike Meldman love Casamigos. On the rocks, by the shot, at times, straight from the bottle. Tequila-filled nights with friends is how Casamigos was born. \n“Our idea was to make the best-tasting, smoothest Tequila and Mezcal that didn’t have to be covered up with salt or lime. So we did.”\n-George Clooney and Rande Gerber\n\nCasamigos, a small batch, ultra-premium tequila made from the finest, hand-selected 100% Blue Weber agaves, grown in the rich red clay and cool climate of the Highlands of Jalisco, Mexico for a minimum of seven years. After harvest, the agave piñas are roasted in traditional brick ovens for 72 hours, before undergoing an extra-slow fermentation process over an additional eighty hours, nearly double the industry standard. \n\nCasamigos Reposado is aged for 7 months. It is soft, slightly oaky with hints of caramel and cocoa. It has a silky texture with a medium to long smooth finish.\nCasamigos Reposado is made to be served chilled, neat, or on the rocks. It is also the perfect base for cocktails such as a classic margarita or paloma. To make a Casamigos Paloma mix 2 oz Casamigos Reposado Tequila, 1 oz fresh grapefruit juice, .75 oz fresh lime juice, .5 oz agave nectar, and 2 dashes of orange bitters in a cocktail shaker. Shake and then strain into a collins glass. Add fresh ice and top off with a splash of grapefruit soda and garnish with a grapefruit slice.\n\nBuy Casamigos Reposado online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\n",

When Kanbar could not find a vodka that met his standards of quality to enjoy in a classic martini, he knew it was time to challenge the status quo as only a San Franciscan can do. Embodying his city’s progressive mindset, Kanbar quadruple-distilled the spirit using a proprietary process that, to this day, provides one of the smoothest drinking experiences possible.\n\nBacked by our history of innovation, and our core value of continuous evolution, SKYY once again recognized an opportunity to lead the next chapter for the vodka category. What started as one man’s mission to create the perfect Martini has now evolved to include the pursuit of a better Vodka & Soda.\n\nToday, SKYY Vodka celebrates San Francisco by joining its namesake with the Pacific Ocean. SKYY is now made with water enriched by Pacific minerals from the San Francisco Bay Area, which add subtle salinity and minerality. They may also reduce bitterness, and enhance the inherent sweetness and/or flavor of some cocktail ingredients, such as grapefruit, elevating your Vodka & Soda drinking experience."\n',

In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\n\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean.",

			'"SKYY Vodka was created in 1992 in San Francisco - the land of progress and diversity - by an inventor who dared to imagine a new, better way to make vodka.\n\nSKYY Vodka was born out of the pioneering thinking of Maurice Kanbar, who reimagined vodka as the world knew it. When Kanbar could not find a vodka that met his standards of quality to enjoy in a classic martini, he knew it was time to challenge the status quo as only a San Franciscan can do. Embodying his city’s progressive mindset, Kanbar quadruple-distilled the spirit using a proprietary process that, to this day, provides one of the smoothest drinking experiences possible.\n\nBacked by our history of innovation, and our core value of continuous evolution, SKYY once again recognized an opportunity to lead the next chapter for the vodka category. What started as one man’s mission to create the perfect Martini has now evolved to include the pursuit of a better Vodka & Soda.\n\nToday, SKYY Vodka celebrates San Francisco by joining its namesake with the Pacific Ocean. SKYY is now made with water enriched by Pacific minerals from the San Francisco Bay Area, which add subtle salinity and minerality. They may also reduce bitterness, and enhance the inherent sweetness and/or flavor of some cocktail ingredients, such as grapefruit, elevating your Vodka & Soda drinking experience."\n',

			"Founded in 1795 and passed down through one family for the past seven generations, Jim Beam is the world's best-selling bourbon. From Tokyo to London to Louisville, Jim Beam sets the benchmark for what a bourbon should be, aged twice as long as required by law for a flavor that's unlike any other. Distilled with corn, malted barley, time, pride and passion, there's a reason why Jim Beam Bourbon is on almost every bar shelf. However, it isn't the name that should entice you. Opening a bottle is the best way to celebrate life events, gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. It's as versatile as it is smooth, something you've probably always aspired to be, yet it does so effortlessly.\n\nTo get the distinct flavor of Jim Beam Bourbon, the distillery ages the liquor in charred oak barrels for a minimum of four years. This imparts a medium body and a caramel color that you've come to know in a bourbon. The oaky, vanilla and spicy backdrop greets you with a swirling of the bourbon, inviting you to taste what lies within the glass. When you finally raise the glass, your taste buds become overwhelmed with a five-pronged attack of sweetness, grain, oak, char and fruit. Most five-pronged attacks are best left to the battlefield or sporting event, but this bludgeons you over the head with flavors that keep you coming back. Enjoy Jim Beam Bourbon on the rocks, with a splash of water or in one of your favorite cocktails.\nBeam Suntory",

Does that matter? Not when it tastes this good. Oh, and it's a great price, too. Pinnacle Vodka is a great everyday spirit for your home bar. It's tasty and infinitely mixable.\n\nHow can you mix it? Any way you want, but start with a classic lemon drop. Stick to this formula: Add sour and sweet to spirit. The spirit is the vodka. For sour you have lemons. Your sweet is in the form of granulated sugar, cubes or simple syrup. Smash the lemons; then shake them with vodka, sweetener and ice. Strain that into a sugar-rimmed martini glass. Bang.\n\nGot it? Now let's twist it up. Substitute half of the lemons for tangerines. Swap the simple syrup for peach schnapps. Serve the drink on the rocks in a big mug with soda. Or try one of Pinnacle's many flavors like Whipped or Kiwi Strawberry. Stick to the sour/sweet/spirit formula and do it your way.\n\nBuy Pinnacle Original Flavored Vodka online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\n\nWinner of Gold Medal & Best Buy at the 2017 BTI",

			"One of the oldest reposado tequilas on the market, Hornitos Reposado has been the center of the party since 1950. It was originally made to celebrate the anniversary of Mexican independence, before reposado was even a thing. The rest is history, and more than six decades later, Hornitos Reposado is beloved by shot takers and margarita lovers around the globe.\n\nWhat goes into a bottle of Hornitos Reposado? This tequila is made from 100 percent blue agave, which is baked in small ovens, mashed, fermented and double-distilled. This pale straw-colored tequila ages for anywhere from two months to a year, typically in former bourbon barrels, before being bottled. Hornitos Reposado is 80-proof, so this tequila definitely packs a punch.\n\nAs a reposado, this tequila is somewhere between the non-aged blancos and the much older añejos. It has a fine agave aroma with some notes of green apple, and you'll also taste hints of apple and herbs. Hornitos Reposado is known as a mellow, full-bodied tequila with plenty of warmth, but don't let that fool you.\n\nSo, what's the best way to drink Hornitos Reposado? Shots, shots, shots, of course! Hornitos Reposado is ideal for tequila shots, as it's easy to drink, and the flavor isn't too complex. It's also great for mixing into classic tequila drinks. Try it in a margarita, with agave syrup, lime juice and a salt rim. If you're feeling fruity, try your Hornitos Reposado in a colorful tequila sunrise, with orange juice and grenadine syrup.\n\nBuy Hornitos Reposado online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

			"Our Irish Whiskey traces its roots back to 1779, but its true name did not come until much later when a salesman by the name of Paddy Flaherty roamed pub to pub with a sales pitch of equal parts smooth triple-distilled whiskey, good humor, and revelry.  Paddy was as beloved as the whiskey he sold, in no small part because of the free rounds he’d give at every stop.  It was only fitting that this fine whiskey became known as Paddy’s.\n\nAn approachable Irish whiskey comprised of a triple-distilled blend of grain, malt and pot-still, Paddy’s is mild and yet crisp, with a hint of honey. Paddy’s is the perfect session spirit for gathering ‘round for good times with friends. Triple-distilled from the finest barley and water from County Cork’s Irish countryside, Paddy’s matures for years in three types of oaken casks, acquiring its distinctively rich and golden color in dark, aromatic warehouses before being shipped directly from Ireland.\n\nTasting Notes:\n• Nose: Malty, fresh, woody. Hints of spice, honey, vanilla.\n• Taste: Light and crisp. Hints of nuts, malt, charred wood.\n• Finish: A gently fading sweetness. A lingering of mild, woody malt.",

Founded in 1783 on the banks of the Ohio River, Evan Williams is one of the oldest distilleries in the country and the first bourbon distillery in Kentucky. Because of its history and secret recipe, Evan Williams Black Label is the premier Kentucky bourbon to suit your tastes.\n\nAs soon as you open a bottle of Evan Williams Black Label, you're met with a rich aroma of vanilla and mint, but this is just the precursor. When it hits your lips, hints of oak, caramel and brown sugar greet you and linger through the satisfying finish.\n\nAlthough purists say the only way to drink bourbon is neat or on the rocks, Evan Williams Black Label lends itself to any number of lavish cocktails. Evan and cola is an all-American choice among cocktails, while an Evan and mineral water brightens the flavor without any harshness.\n\nIf you're into something that introduces more flavors, a classic mint julep or Manhattan transports you to the Kentucky Derby or the Big Apple, that is unless you already live in one of these cities. If not, experiment on your own with juices, sodas and mixers, and name it after your hometown. With any luck, a Des Moines Fury will catch on like wildfire. Evan Williams Black Label lets you show off your creativity behind the bar.\n\nBuy Evan Williams Black online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

Balvenie believes in mastering and controlling the Five Crafts of whisky: barley, malt, stills, barrels and the malt master.\n\nThey handle every aspect of creating The Balvenie 12 year Doublewood, from the first seed to the final approval of Malt Master David C. Stewart, whose nose and palate have been sharpened at the distillery since 1962.\n\nThe Balvenie presents the ultimate line of painstakingly crafted Scotch whiskies. The Double Wood ages 12 years in American Oak Bourbon barrels, then finishes in Spanish Oak Sherry casks. The final product carries the sweet fruit from the Sherry, charred notes from the Bourbon and the character of a meticulous crew of craftspeople.\n\nThis Speyside whisky tastes fine after dinner or with a Maduro cigar. The nose carries dark chocolate, raspberries and fresh bread. The taste blends berries and cherries with pepper and exotic spices. The finish is long and viscous with lingering hints of red fruit.\n\nThe 12 Year is a great addition to your Scotch collection. You'll have some Highland, Islay, Lowland and Cambeltown, but this is one of the only whiskies you'll find aged in two different barrels. It sets itself apart.\n\nHow should you drink it? Pour it in your favorite straight-sided glass, neat. Put a glass of ice or water next to it. Some sippers like a splash of water \"to wake up the whisky.\" Have your first sip straight, then drop in a cube to cool it a touch. The water will expand the flavor. Any way you have it, you'll taste the love and care of dedicated distillers.\n\nBuy The Balvenie 12 year Doublewood online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

Not only is it named after the boyhood home of Abraham Lincoln, it has some highly acclaimed brothers in the Jim Beam family: Booker's, Basil Hayden's and Baker's.\n\nAged nine years, Knob Creek is the oldest by a couple years. The extra aging draws more flavor and sugar from the wood, providing a full-bodied, fruity flavor with hints of grass and grain. It's 100-proof, which is considered the honest age of bourbons made a century ago. The Beam family makes this spirit with extra char on white oak barrels for a bigger flavor.\n\nKnob Creek Bourbon is comfortable on the top shelf of any home bar. You should put it right up there with the best names from Tennessee, Ireland, Canada or Scotland. It's a great dessert after a grilled steak and is at home with a cigar next to your ash tray.\n\nHow does it mix? Its bold, organic flavor stands up well in cocktails if you must mix it. Fresh mint and a hint of sugar make a fine Julep. It makes a nice old fashioned with orange, bitters and a cherry. The family suggests you try a new fashioned. Instead of sugar, use Amaretto as a sweetener. Mix that with bitters and an orange peel. Serve it up or on the rocks.\n\nWhatever you do, taste it with a little extra patience. It spent nine long years getting to you. Don't rush it.\n\nBuy Knob Creek Bourbon Whiskey online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\n\nWinner of Double Gold Medal at the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition",

			"For over 150 years, Campari has been a favorite liqueur for drinkers with different tastes. The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

Ian was one of the biggest influences in the history of Laphroaig indeed he was one of the first distillers to travel to bourbon county in the USA to identify new sources of casks that would give him greater consistency as well as new flavours. He later married this ‘new’ style of Laphroaig with his traditionally matured (European cask) Laphroaig.    Inspired by his early work , we have used Oloroso sherry butts, straight American white oak (non-filled with bourbon), PX seasoned hogsheads, Quarter Casks and finally of course first fill Bourbon Casks. This varied cask maturation technique enabled us to create 6 new flavour combinations that were then tested with our FOL’s to choose their favourite style and indeed name.

In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\n\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean.",

			"Since 1824, The Glenlivet distillery in Sepyside, Scotland, has produced one of the most famous malts in the world – The Glenlivet 12 Year. This Speyside single malt Scotch whisky boasts a delicate balance of sweet summer fruits and spring flowers. You will also notice aromas of pineapple, pear, toasted cereal and honey, the latter of which shows up again on the finish.\n\nThe Glenlivet distilled in pots that still use 100 percent malted barley. It is then aged in traditional European and bourbon-seasoned American oak casks to bring forth the delectable flavors. Despite being produced in Scotland, The Glenlivet is the bestselling malt whisky in the United States. It is also the second-best single malt in the world, so you know you're buying the good stuff!\n\nNo other malt whisky has the legendary status enjoyed by The Glenlivet 12 Year. Its smooth character and tropical fruity notes make it a first-class malt, along with the mineral-rich spring water drawn from the distillery's historic well.\n\nSo, what does \"single malt\" mean, anyway? Single malt whisky is simply a malted whisky that has been made from a single distillery. As for the malted part, the whisky is made using malted grains as opposed to unmalted ones. According to Scotch Whisky Regulations, single malt Scotch whisky must be made with malted barley, distilled in a single distillery using pot stills and aged for at least three years. The Glenlivet, being a 12-year Scotch, is aged for 12. It's also a Speyside single malt Scotch, which means that it's produced in the River Spey region in northeastern Scotland.\n\nThe Glenlivet 12 Year is a vibrant gold hue with a summery nose. Since its palate is well balanced with forward tropical fruit notes, it's best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or with a little water added. At the finish, you'll savor a smooth creaminess with hints of fresh hazelnuts and marzipan.\n\nPair The Glenlivet with seafood dishes, such as seared scallops, to bring out the best characteristics in both. Even if you've never tasted a malt whisky before, The Glenlivet will make anyone a fan.\n\nBuy The Glenlivet 12 Year online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

			"Cazadores Reposado hails from Arandas in the Mexican state of Jalisco, where the Cazadores distillery has been producing tequila since 1922. For almost a century, Cazadores has built its tequila empire on tradition, keeping its production and classic recipes a secret. In fact, as the legend goes, founder Don José Maria perfected his recipe, wrote it down and then promptly locked it up in a box and hid it.\n\nSo what goes into each bottle of Cazadores Reposado? Today, the Cazadores distillery still takes a small-batch approach. Like all of Mexico's top-tier tequilas, Cazadores Reposado is made from 100 percent blue agave. First it's baked, then the agave leaves are shredded. After, the agave is double-fermented and double-distilled, according to the original recipe. As a reposado, it's aged in new oak casks prior to bottling.\n\nWhen you sip Cazadores Reposado, you'll get a taste of the Jalisco Highlands and smell the agave aroma. You'll also notice warm tasting notes, including baked pear, cinnamon and vanilla. The hint of white pepper adds some spice to this tequila, and the oaky notes keep it down to earth.\n\nHow can you enjoy Cazadores Reposado to the fullest? This smooth tequila is great for drinking straight, as its flavor is complex enough for sipping. If you're going for neat, keep in mind that Cazadores Reposado is best served chilled. Lighten up this reposado by pairing it with lemon-lime soda or mix Cazadores Reposado into tequila drinks such as tequila smashes or tequila fizzes.\n\nBuy Cazadores Reposado online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

			"Maker's Mark started with bread, of course. Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable – just not in a predictable way.\n\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\n\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan. Buy Maker’s Mark Whisky online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

			"Dark, bold and packed with intense flavor, Jägermeister is unlike any liqueur you've ever sipped before. Originally a celebratory drink for hunters (hence the \"jäger\"), it's the ideal drink to mark every big win — or even a well-deserved weekend. Jäger is 70 proof, so you know this liqueur means business.\n\nA true classic, the Jägermeister recipe hasn't changed since it was first made in 1878 in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. This dark-colored liqueur is made with 56 different herbs and spices, including licorice, anise, ginger, juniper berries and citrus peel. The herb and spice blend is steeped in water and alcohol, and its aged in oak barrels for a year. Then it's mixed with sugar and alcohol before it's bottled and shipped right to your front door.\n\nEven the Jägermeister bottle is custom. As the story goes, distiller Curt Mast and his buddies spent a lot of time hunting and needed a bottle that could stand up to their outdoorsy lifestyle. Mast did what anyone would do and dropped a bunch of bottles on the floor until he found a shape that held up to his tests.\n\nThe easiest way to enjoy Jägermeister is in the form of an ice-cold shot, preferably chilled to zero degrees. But if you're more of a cocktail fan, try a Jäger Tonic with tonic water, citrus zest and ice.\n\nBuy Jägermeister online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door.",

			"One of the oldest reposado tequilas on the market, Hornitos Reposado has been the center of the party since 1950. It was originally made to celebrate the anniversary of Mexican independence, before reposado was even a thing. The rest is history, and more than six decades later, Hornitos Reposado is beloved by shot takers and margarita lovers around the globe.\n\nWhat goes into a bottle of Hornitos Reposado? This tequila is made from 100 percent blue agave, which is baked in small ovens, mashed, fermented and double-distilled. This pale straw-colored tequila ages for anywhere from two months to a year, typically in former bourbon barrels, before being bottled. Hornitos Reposado is 80-proof, so this tequila definitely packs a punch.\n\nAs a reposado, this tequila is somewhere between the non-aged blancos and the much older añejos. It has a fine agave aroma with some notes of green apple, and you'll also taste hints of apple and herbs. Hornitos Reposado is known as a mellow, full-bodied tequila with plenty of warmth, but don't let that fool you.\n\nSo, what's the best way to drink Hornitos Reposado? Shots, shots, shots, of course! Hornitos Reposado is ideal for tequila shots, as it's easy to drink, and the flavor isn't too complex. It's also great for mixing into classic tequila drinks. Try it in a margarita, with agave syrup, lime juice and a salt rim. If you're feeling fruity, try your Hornitos Reposado in a colorful tequila sunrise, with orange juice and grenadine syrup.\n\nBuy Hornitos Reposado online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

When Kanbar could not find a vodka that met his standards of quality to enjoy in a classic martini, he knew it was time to challenge the status quo as only a San Franciscan can do. Embodying his city’s progressive mindset, Kanbar quadruple-distilled the spirit using a proprietary process that, to this day, provides one of the smoothest drinking experiences possible.\n\nBacked by our history of innovation, and our core value of continuous evolution, SKYY once again recognized an opportunity to lead the next chapter for the vodka category. What started as one man’s mission to create the perfect Martini has now evolved to include the pursuit of a better Vodka & Soda.\n\nToday, SKYY Vodka celebrates San Francisco by joining its namesake with the Pacific Ocean. SKYY is now made with water enriched by Pacific minerals from the San Francisco Bay Area, which add subtle salinity and minerality. They may also reduce bitterness, and enhance the inherent sweetness and/or flavor of some cocktail ingredients, such as grapefruit, elevating your Vodka & Soda drinking experience."\n',

Then you taste notes of white pepper, lemon peel and juniper with a floral finish.\n\nThere are many famous old names in vodka. Pinnacle ain't one of them. They've only been around since 2002. Does that matter? Not when it tastes this good. Oh, and it's a great price, too. Pinnacle Vodka is a great everyday spirit for your home bar. It's tasty and infinitely mixable.\n\nHow can you mix it? Any way you want, but start with a classic lemon drop. Stick to this formula: Add sour and sweet to spirit. The spirit is the vodka. For sour you have lemons. Your sweet is in the form of granulated sugar, cubes or simple syrup. Smash the lemons; then shake them with vodka, sweetener and ice. Strain that into a sugar-rimmed martini glass. Bang.\n\nGot it? Now let's twist it up. Substitute half of the lemons for tangerines. Swap the simple syrup for peach schnapps. Serve the drink on the rocks in a big mug with soda. Or try one of Pinnacle's many flavors like Whipped or Kiwi Strawberry. Stick to the sour/sweet/spirit formula and do it your way.\n\nBuy Pinnacle Original Flavored Vodka online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\n\nWinner of Gold Medal & Best Buy at the 2017 BTI",

			"Drinking scotch is not for the faint of heart. However, that doesn't mean it comes with a huge price tag. That's why there's Dewar's White Label. Distilled for the man or woman who wants a smooth scotch without all the extras, Dewar's White Label is where it's at, wherever you want to be.\n\nSince 1899, this scotch whiskey has been produced with a time-honored traditional distillation process. Honey, vanilla, apple and wood combine into a versatile and soothing mix with an aftertaste of smokiness and a bit of fudge. That means you can indulge in divine chocolatey goodness without having to head to a candy shop or the grocery store.\n\nThe best way to drink Dewar's White Label is to uncork it and let it breathe. Wait just a few minutes before you pour it into your favorite rocks glass or snifter. This allows the blend to explode with flavor, leaving you in its wake. It's not often you want to take a grenade to the face, but if it's Dewar's White Label, you'll probably let it slide. A predisposition for mischief may also call for a Dewar's on its own. Keep this in the cabinet for times that call for fun and playfulness.\n\nIf you simply must have a cocktail, Dewar's White Label is nothing short of a fantastic mixer. Blend it with sweet vermouth and bitter for a classy Rob Roy. For something subtler, combine equal parts Dewar's White Label with amaretto for a delicious beverage.\n\nBuy Dewar’s White Label online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

The Myers’ family commitment to producing the highest quality, genuine Jamaican rum drove this brand to global recognition; today, we are proud to honor that legacy by using only the finest ingredients in every bottle.  \n\nMyers’s Rum is produced from pure sugarcane juice that is boiled into molasses, fermented, and expertly distilled using both continuous and pot sill distillation methods. After distillation, the rum is matured for up to four years in white oak barrels. It is this final aging period that contributes to Myers’s distinctive color, aroma, and taste guaranteed to elevate your drink with authentic Caribbean flavor. \n\nExperience buttery notes upon entry followed by sweet sugar cane, caramel, tobacco, leather, honey, and dark chocolate with elements of raisin and fig. The finish has a decadent dark chocolate character with brown sugar, smokiness and underlying oak notes that make Myers’s a genuine original that stands the test of time.  \n\nEnjoy our signature Myers’s Planters’ Punch:  \n\n•\t1 part freshly squeezed lime juice \n•\t2 parts Stirrings Simple Syrup \n•\t3 parts Myers’s Original Dark rum \n•\tDash of bitters \n•\tOrange slice (for garnish) \n\nMix ingredients in a shaker filled with ice and shake well. Serve in highball glass filled with shaved ice and garnish with an orange slice. \n\nCelebrate 140 years of rum-making tradition passed down straight to your glass with one of our signature cocktails or craft your own favorites. \n",

			'"SKYY Vodka was created in 1992 in San Francisco - the land of progress and diversity - by an inventor who dared to imagine a new, better way to make vodka.\n\nSKYY Vodka was born out of the pioneering thinking of Maurice Kanbar, who reimagined vodka as the world knew it. When Kanbar could not find a vodka that met his standards of quality to enjoy in a classic martini, he knew it was time to challenge the status quo as only a San Franciscan can do. Embodying his city’s progressive mindset, Kanbar quadruple-distilled the spirit using a proprietary process that, to this day, provides one of the smoothest drinking experiences possible.\n\nBacked by our history of innovation, and our core value of continuous evolution, SKYY once again recognized an opportunity to lead the next chapter for the vodka category. What started as one man’s mission to create the perfect Martini has now evolved to include the pursuit of a better Vodka & Soda.\n\nToday, SKYY Vodka celebrates San Francisco by joining its namesake with the Pacific Ocean. SKYY is now made with water enriched by Pacific minerals from the San Francisco Bay Area, which add subtle salinity and minerality. They may also reduce bitterness, and enhance the inherent sweetness and/or flavor of some cocktail ingredients, such as grapefruit, elevating your Vodka & Soda drinking experience."\n',

A quadruple-distilled pure grain spirit made from English wheat is redistilled with ten traditional botanicals, creating a gin of outstanding flavour and smoothness.  Broker’s Gin does not follow the modern trend of using weird and wonderful spirits and botanicals. There are no oddball ingredients in Broker’s Gin.

Broker’s Gin does not follow the modern trend of using weird and wonderful spirits and botanicals. There are no oddball ingredients in Broker’s Gin.

			"Dark, bold and packed with intense flavor, Jägermeister is unlike any liqueur you've ever sipped before. Originally a celebratory drink for hunters (hence the \"jäger\"), it's the ideal drink to mark every big win — or even a well-deserved weekend. Jäger is 70 proof, so you know this liqueur means business.\n\nA true classic, the Jägermeister recipe hasn't changed since it was first made in 1878 in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. This dark-colored liqueur is made with 56 different herbs and spices, including licorice, anise, ginger, juniper berries and citrus peel. The herb and spice blend is steeped in water and alcohol, and its aged in oak barrels for a year. Then it's mixed with sugar and alcohol before it's bottled and shipped right to your front door.\n\nEven the Jägermeister bottle is custom. As the story goes, distiller Curt Mast and his buddies spent a lot of time hunting and needed a bottle that could stand up to their outdoorsy lifestyle. Mast did what anyone would do and dropped a bunch of bottles on the floor until he found a shape that held up to his tests.\n\nThe easiest way to enjoy Jägermeister is in the form of an ice-cold shot, preferably chilled to zero degrees. But if you're more of a cocktail fan, try a Jäger Tonic with tonic water, citrus zest and ice.\n\nBuy Jägermeister online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door.",

Because of its history and secret recipe, Evan Williams Black Label is the premier Kentucky bourbon to suit your tastes.\n\nAs soon as you open a bottle of Evan Williams Black Label, you're met with a rich aroma of vanilla and mint, but this is just the precursor. When it hits your lips, hints of oak, caramel and brown sugar greet you and linger through the satisfying finish.\n\nAlthough purists say the only way to drink bourbon is neat or on the rocks, Evan Williams Black Label lends itself to any number of lavish cocktails. Evan and cola is an all-American choice among cocktails, while an Evan and mineral water brightens the flavor without any harshness.\n\nIf you're into something that introduces more flavors, a classic mint julep or Manhattan transports you to the Kentucky Derby or the Big Apple, that is unless you already live in one of these cities. If not, experiment on your own with juices, sodas and mixers, and name it after your hometown. With any luck, a Des Moines Fury will catch on like wildfire.

			'Ancient buffalo carved paths through the wilderness that led American pioneers and explorers to new frontiers. One such trail led to the banks of the Kentucky River where Buffalo Trace Distillery has been making bourbon whiskey the same way for more than 200 years. In tribute to the mighty buffalo and the rugged, independent spirit of the pioneers who followed them, we created our signature Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey.\n\nBuffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is distilled, aged and bottled at the most award-winning distillery in the world. Made from the finest corn, rye and barley malt, this whiskey ages in new oak barrels for years in century old warehouses until the peak of maturity. The taste is rich and complex, with hints of vanilla, toffee and candied fruit. The smooth finish lingers on the palate. This will never change.\n\nTASTING NOTES\nThis deep amber whiskey has a complex aroma of vanilla, mint and molasses. Pleasantly sweet to the taste with notes of brown sugar and spice that give way to oak,  toffee, dark fruit and anise. This whiskey finishes long and smooth with serious depth.\n\nRATINGS\nWine Enthusiast rating: 93 \n\nREVIEWS\n"One of the world\'s great whiskeys."

			"You may think you have run the gamut of American bourbons, but if you haven't tried Evan Williams Black, you aren't quite finished with your foray into one of America's finest exports. Founded in 1783 on the banks of the Ohio River, Evan Williams is one of the oldest distilleries in the country and the first bourbon distillery in Kentucky. Because of its history and secret recipe, Evan Williams Black Label is the premier Kentucky bourbon to suit your tastes.\n\nAs soon as you open a bottle of Evan Williams Black Label, you're met with a rich aroma of vanilla and mint, but this is just the precursor. When it hits your lips, hints of oak, caramel and brown sugar greet you and linger through the satisfying finish.\n\nAlthough purists say the only way to drink bourbon is neat or on the rocks, Evan Williams Black Label lends itself to any number of lavish cocktails. Evan and cola is an all-American choice among cocktails, while an Evan and mineral water brightens the flavor without any harshness.\n\nIf you're into something that introduces more flavors, a classic mint julep or Manhattan transports you to the Kentucky Derby or the Big Apple, that is unless you already live in one of these cities. If not, experiment on your own with juices, sodas and mixers, and name it after your hometown. With any luck, a Des Moines Fury will catch on like wildfire. Evan Williams Black Label lets you show off your creativity behind the bar.\n\nBuy Evan Williams Black online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

One of the most distinct vodkas on the market, Cîroc is sure to stick with you.\n\nCîroc may be distilled from grapes, but when you sip this vodka, you'll taste some lightly fruity notes rather than a full-on grape flavor. Look for notes of orange and anise and enjoy the crisp finish of this luxurious spirit.\n\nSure, you can sip Cîroc. But why not mix it in a celebrity-inspired cocktail? Try The Diddy, which includes equal parts Cîroc and lemonade, or the Lola, which boasts pomegranate juice and a splash of bubbly. No matter how you enjoy it, this is a vodka that's ideal for celebrations.

Distilled for the man or woman who wants a smooth scotch without all the extras, Dewar's White Label is where it's at, wherever you want to be.\n\nSince 1899, this scotch whiskey has been produced with a time-honored traditional distillation process. Honey, vanilla, apple and wood combine into a versatile and soothing mix with an aftertaste of smokiness and a bit of fudge. That means you can indulge in divine chocolatey goodness without having to head to a candy shop or the grocery store.\n\nThe best way to drink Dewar's White Label is to uncork it and let it breathe. Wait just a few minutes before you pour it into your favorite rocks glass or snifter. This allows the blend to explode with flavor, leaving you in its wake. It's not often you want to take a grenade to the face, but if it's Dewar's White Label, you'll probably let it slide. A predisposition for mischief may also call for a Dewar's on its own. Keep this in the cabinet for times that call for fun and playfulness.\n\nIf you simply must have a cocktail, Dewar's White Label is nothing short of a fantastic mixer. Blend it with sweet vermouth and bitter for a classy Rob Roy. For something subtler, combine equal parts Dewar's White Label with amaretto for a delicious beverage.\n\nBuy Dewar’s White Label online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

			"Bacardi Superior is Bacardi's flagship rum and the one that started it all way back in 1862. In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\n\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean.",

			"One of the oldest reposado tequilas on the market, Hornitos Reposado has been the center of the party since 1950. It was originally made to celebrate the anniversary of Mexican independence, before reposado was even a thing. The rest is history, and more than six decades later, Hornitos Reposado is beloved by shot takers and margarita lovers around the globe.\n\nWhat goes into a bottle of Hornitos Reposado? This tequila is made from 100 percent blue agave, which is baked in small ovens, mashed, fermented and double-distilled. This pale straw-colored tequila ages for anywhere from two months to a year, typically in former bourbon barrels, before being bottled. Hornitos Reposado is 80-proof, so this tequila definitely packs a punch.\n\nAs a reposado, this tequila is somewhere between the non-aged blancos and the much older añejos. It has a fine agave aroma with some notes of green apple, and you'll also taste hints of apple and herbs. Hornitos Reposado is known as a mellow, full-bodied tequila with plenty of warmth, but don't let that fool you.\n\nSo, what's the best way to drink Hornitos Reposado? Shots, shots, shots, of course! Hornitos Reposado is ideal for tequila shots, as it's easy to drink, and the flavor isn't too complex. It's also great for mixing into classic tequila drinks. Try it in a margarita, with agave syrup, lime juice and a salt rim. If you're feeling fruity, try your Hornitos Reposado in a colorful tequila sunrise, with orange juice and grenadine syrup.\n\nBuy Hornitos Reposado online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

			"Founded in 1795 and passed down through one family for the past seven generations, Jim Beam is the world's best-selling bourbon. From Tokyo to London to Louisville, Jim Beam sets the benchmark for what a bourbon should be, aged twice as long as required by law for a flavor that's unlike any other. Distilled with corn, malted barley, time, pride and passion, there's a reason why Jim Beam Bourbon is on almost every bar shelf. However, it isn't the name that should entice you. Opening a bottle is the best way to celebrate life events, gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. It's as versatile as it is smooth, something you've probably always aspired to be, yet it does so effortlessly.\n\nTo get the distinct flavor of Jim Beam Bourbon, the distillery ages the liquor in charred oak barrels for a minimum of four years. This imparts a medium body and a caramel color that you've come to know in a bourbon. The oaky, vanilla and spicy backdrop greets you with a swirling of the bourbon, inviting you to taste what lies within the glass. When you finally raise the glass, your taste buds become overwhelmed with a five-pronged attack of sweetness, grain, oak, char and fruit. Most five-pronged attacks are best left to the battlefield or sporting event, but this bludgeons you over the head with flavors that keep you coming back. Enjoy Jim Beam Bourbon on the rocks, with a splash of water or in one of your favorite cocktails.\nBeam Suntory",

			"Los Vecinos Del Campo honors centuries old distilling traditions of Oaxaca and the people whose families have produced these rich spirits for generations. After growing & maturing for 7- 20 years, the local grown agave is harvested by hand. The agave hearts are then slow-roasted underground for 4-7 days to develop the sultry, smoky-sweet flavor profile. After roasting, the piñas are crushed using a stone molino, then naturally fermented in a wooden vat for 7-15 days- depending on time of year. These artisanal mezcals are then double distilled using copper pot stills.\nThe end products are sophisticated yet wild mezcals of the highest quality that taste of the generations of expertise behind them.\n\nIn partnership with Carmen Villarreal and Casa San Matias, Los Vecinos works to promote sustainability and support to the people and communities who create these exquisite mezcals. Los Vecinos Del Campo translates to “Neighbors of the Field” and in the tiny villages of Oaxaca, Mexico where these artisanal mezcals are created, neighbors are family.  \n\n\nProduction description: \n• Agave: 100% Espadin\n• Serving: Savor and sip neat or mix into an array of cocktails. This 90-proof mezcal stands up well!\n• Appearance: Void of color; sediment-free clarity.\n• Aroma: Powerful aromas of baked pineapple and canned pineapple juice have an earthy core.\n\n\nTasting Notes:\nIt’s all spice up front in the mouth, quickly moving to roasted tropical fruits, tender young ginger, and green bell peppers.\n\n“This wonderful mezcal is the ideal marriage of unruly, wild mezcal and distilling sophistication.” – F.

This Mexican liquor is a little harder to find than tequila and other options, but Del Maguey has made its Vida Mezcal easy to get and at an entry-level price. It tastes delicious in mixed drinks and will introduce you to the world of mezcal.\r\n\r\nThis mezcal is distilled twice and hand-crafted. Del Maguey uses wood-fired copper stills, which bring out fruity aromas and other sweet notes such as honey and vanilla. On your palate, experience cinnamon, banana, tangerine and even sandalwood.\r\n\r\nWondering why you should opt for mezcal over tequila? Both mezcal and tequila are Mexican liquors distilled from the agave plant. Mezcal and tequila come from different regions in Mexico and often from different varieties of agave plant. Tequila must come from the Blue Agave plant, while mezcal can come from any agave plant. Most mezcal comes from Agave Espadin, including the Del Maguey Vida variety.\r\n\r\nThough you can try sipping Del Maguey Vida Mezcal to understand what mezcal is and how it should taste, this mezcal is designed to taste delicious in cocktails. The fruit notes and long finish make it perfect for fruitier mixes, such as a Sierra Madre Sunrise, which is made of mezcal plus Aperol, chocolate bitters and lemon juice. Try making a Mezcal Julep with basil and cranberry for a fruity twist on the classic. Remember to use quality juices and ripe fruits for best results.\r\n\r\nBuy Del Maguey Vida Mezcal online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

			"Maker's Mark started with bread, of course. Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable – just not in a predictable way.\n\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\n\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan. Buy Maker’s Mark Whisky online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

It leaves fine citrus on the palate, balanced by fruity sweetness for a dry and firm finish. The colour suggests a bright full-bodied liqueur, rich and full of flavour. Dry Orange Curaçao is one of the old Bols liqueurs of which various recipes were in use in the past. It was introduced at the World Exhibition in Antwerp in 1885 when a journalist described it as: “Nectar of the gods, distilled from sweet sugar from the West (Indies).”Sometimes overshadowed by the success of Triple Sec Curaçao, Dry Orange is nonetheless THE only ingredient to use for some of the world’s most important rum cocktails, like the Mai Tai. Bols Dry Orange Curaçao is itself based on a molasses distillate, and mixes far better in cocktails than grain or brandy-based liqueurs.",

He started with a soft drink by the name of Citrus Club that was bottled in Phoenix, Arizona (which was quite popular in that part of the country).    Bishop’s experimentation resulted in a soft drink made from grapefruit juice and sugar that he believed to be the freshest tasting soft drink available on the market. He thought it tasted like a slice of grapefruit exploding in the mouth, so he called it “Squirt”.    - See more at: http://blog.retroplanet.com/soda-pop-of-the-week-squirt-soda/#sthash.8tmIfGbB.dpuf",

			"Dark, bold and packed with intense flavor, Jägermeister is unlike any liqueur you've ever sipped before. Originally a celebratory drink for hunters (hence the \"jäger\"), it's the ideal drink to mark every big win — or even a well-deserved weekend. Jäger is 70 proof, so you know this liqueur means business.\n\nA true classic, the Jägermeister recipe hasn't changed since it was first made in 1878 in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. This dark-colored liqueur is made with 56 different herbs and spices, including licorice, anise, ginger, juniper berries and citrus peel. The herb and spice blend is steeped in water and alcohol, and its aged in oak barrels for a year. Then it's mixed with sugar and alcohol before it's bottled and shipped right to your front door.\n\nEven the Jägermeister bottle is custom. As the story goes, distiller Curt Mast and his buddies spent a lot of time hunting and needed a bottle that could stand up to their outdoorsy lifestyle. Mast did what anyone would do and dropped a bunch of bottles on the floor until he found a shape that held up to his tests.\n\nThe easiest way to enjoy Jägermeister is in the form of an ice-cold shot, preferably chilled to zero degrees. But if you're more of a cocktail fan, try a Jäger Tonic with tonic water, citrus zest and ice.\n\nBuy Jägermeister online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door.",

When ready, both the liquid and the solid parts are distilled in traditional copper pot stills, separating the heart from heads and tails. Only the heart of the distillate is then allowed to mature in ash-wood vats. \r\n\r\nThe last process consists in transforming the distillate in liqueur by adding a simple syrup of water and sugar lowering the ABV to 32%. Crystal clear in colour, the aroma is typical of marasca cherry distillate with strong alcohol spirit and roasted nuttiness, while the taste results smooth but sharp at the same time with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and orange marmalade. The tall green bottle with its red cap is still hand-plaited in straw within the company, and resembles the Maraschino bottles produced in Zara in the early days, where the straw was placed in order to prevent damage during transportation.\r\n\r\nLuxardo Maraschino Originale can be enjoyed in many classic cocktails or neat as an after dinner drink.

			"Since 1824, The Glenlivet distillery in Sepyside, Scotland, has produced one of the most famous malts in the world – The Glenlivet 12 Year. This Speyside single malt Scotch whisky boasts a delicate balance of sweet summer fruits and spring flowers. You will also notice aromas of pineapple, pear, toasted cereal and honey, the latter of which shows up again on the finish.\n\nThe Glenlivet distilled in pots that still use 100 percent malted barley. It is then aged in traditional European and bourbon-seasoned American oak casks to bring forth the delectable flavors. Despite being produced in Scotland, The Glenlivet is the bestselling malt whisky in the United States. It is also the second-best single malt in the world, so you know you're buying the good stuff!\n\nNo other malt whisky has the legendary status enjoyed by The Glenlivet 12 Year. Its smooth character and tropical fruity notes make it a first-class malt, along with the mineral-rich spring water drawn from the distillery's historic well.\n\nSo, what does \"single malt\" mean, anyway? Single malt whisky is simply a malted whisky that has been made from a single distillery. As for the malted part, the whisky is made using malted grains as opposed to unmalted ones. According to Scotch Whisky Regulations, single malt Scotch whisky must be made with malted barley, distilled in a single distillery using pot stills and aged for at least three years. The Glenlivet, being a 12-year Scotch, is aged for 12. It's also a Speyside single malt Scotch, which means that it's produced in the River Spey region in northeastern Scotland.\n\nThe Glenlivet 12 Year is a vibrant gold hue with a summery nose. Since its palate is well balanced with forward tropical fruit notes, it's best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or with a little water added. At the finish, you'll savor a smooth creaminess with hints of fresh hazelnuts and marzipan.\n\nPair The Glenlivet with seafood dishes, such as seared scallops, to bring out the best characteristics in both. Even if you've never tasted a malt whisky before, The Glenlivet will make anyone a fan.\n\nBuy The Glenlivet 12 Year online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

It also has no grain whisky whatsoever anywhere in or even near the drink. It\'s barley all the way, folks.\n\nThe name Monkey Shoulder might sound funny, but it has a history in whisky making. The maltmen who used to turn the barley would take long shifts, using their dominant arm significantly while working. At the end, their shoulders would droop on one side, an ailment that became known as "Monkey Shoulder." Today, nobody working at Monkey Shoulder actually has the affliction, though the barley still gets turned by hand. Working conditions are much better than they used to be. The name sounds cool and harkens back to the old whisky making days.\n\nMonkey Shoulder tastes delicious neat, with a splash of water, and on the rocks. It stands out in mixed drinks, too, given its orange and vanilla flavors with a bit of spice. Try it in a Rob Roy or a Blood and Sand to impress your palate and your friends.\n\nBuy Monkey Shoulder Blended Scotch online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.',

Unlike many scotch and whiskey brands out there, The Balvenie still uses a floor malting process. They steep the barley in water then spread it across the floor. It is turned and malted by hand, which is a long and difficult process.\n\nOnce the liquid for The Balvenie Caribbean Cask 14 Year has been made it's aged in oak casts. After 14 years, it is moved into Caribbean rum casks to get some extra flavor before being sold.\n\nIt's unlikely that you'll want to mix anything with it. The flavors are too unique to pass up.

			"Bacardi Superior is Bacardi's flagship rum and the one that started it all way back in 1862. In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\n\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean.",

Oaxaca is one of the most geographically diverse states in Mexico, with a wide array of microclimates, vegetation, and ecosystems. Nuestra Soledad is made using 100% agave Espadín, cultivated in the remote mountain areas around the Valles Centrales region of Oaxaca, alongside wild vegetation and planted in varying soil types, resulting in an array of flavor profiles. Even more importantly, each mezcalero employs his own methods, often passed down through the generations. Every decision impacts the final character of the mezcal. The environmental diversity, combined with the human element of mezcal production, result in six unique mezcals, despite all six being made from a single agave variety: Espadín.",

This small-batch gin is produced by William Grant & Sons and infused with cucumber, rose and traditional juniper at the brand's Scottish distillery. Small batches are typically defined as 1,000 liters or fewer, but Hendrick's Gin is crafted in tiny 500-liter batches, giving the master distiller more control over her artistry.\n\nHendrick's is the result of combining two different spirits from rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. The exceptionally smooth gin features a nice balance of subtle flavors, which include wonderful notes of flowers, fruits, roots and seeds from across the world. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick's as the \"Best Gin in the World.\"\n\nWilliam Grant & Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\n\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets. Gordon's Cup is a sour-and-salty concoction that marries cucumber, salt and pepper, lime juice and freshly ground salt and pepper. If that's too ambitious, try a simple Gin & Tonic using Hendrick's.\n\nBuy Hendrick’s Gin online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick up in store.",

Founded in 1783 on the banks of the Ohio River, Evan Williams is one of the oldest distilleries in the country and the first bourbon distillery in Kentucky. Because of its history and secret recipe, Evan Williams Black Label is the premier Kentucky bourbon to suit your tastes.\n\nAs soon as you open a bottle of Evan Williams Black Label, you're met with a rich aroma of vanilla and mint, but this is just the precursor. When it hits your lips, hints of oak, caramel and brown sugar greet you and linger through the satisfying finish.\n\nAlthough purists say the only way to drink bourbon is neat or on the rocks, Evan Williams Black Label lends itself to any number of lavish cocktails. Evan and cola is an all-American choice among cocktails, while an Evan and mineral water brightens the flavor without any harshness.\n\nIf you're into something that introduces more flavors, a classic mint julep or Manhattan transports you to the Kentucky Derby or the Big Apple, that is unless you already live in one of these cities. If not, experiment on your own with juices, sodas and mixers, and name it after your hometown. With any luck, a Des Moines Fury will catch on like wildfire.

			"Founded in 1795 and passed down through one family for the past seven generations, Jim Beam is the world's best-selling bourbon. From Tokyo to London to Louisville, Jim Beam sets the benchmark for what a bourbon should be, aged twice as long as required by law for a flavor that's unlike any other. Distilled with corn, malted barley, time, pride and passion, there's a reason why Jim Beam Bourbon is on almost every bar shelf. However, it isn't the name that should entice you. Opening a bottle is the best way to celebrate life events, gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. It's as versatile as it is smooth, something you've probably always aspired to be, yet it does so effortlessly.\n\nTo get the distinct flavor of Jim Beam Bourbon, the distillery ages the liquor in charred oak barrels for a minimum of four years. This imparts a medium body and a caramel color that you've come to know in a bourbon. The oaky, vanilla and spicy backdrop greets you with a swirling of the bourbon, inviting you to taste what lies within the glass. When you finally raise the glass, your taste buds become overwhelmed with a five-pronged attack of sweetness, grain, oak, char and fruit. Most five-pronged attacks are best left to the battlefield or sporting event, but this bludgeons you over the head with flavors that keep you coming back. Enjoy Jim Beam Bourbon on the rocks, with a splash of water or in one of your favorite cocktails.\nBeam Suntory",

			"Founded in 1772, Veuve Clicquot is synonymous with the art of living. The House style distinguishes itself through the dominance of Pinot Noir which gives strength, complexity, and elegance to our wines.\n\nIn spring 2012, the region faced a heavy rainfall of 60% above the average of the season, followed by late frost, and ﬁnally, a series of severe hailstorms which ruined more than 1,000 hectares of the overall Champagne vineyard. Then summer came around mid-August and brought ideal sunny conditions, very dry weather, and high temperatures until the end of the harvest. Despite the weather challenges which led to a relatively modest harvest, quality is optimal, revealing a great aging potential for the wines. \n\nAs with any Veuve Clicquot champagne, Pinot Noir dominates the blend (51%) exclusively from Grands and Premiers Crus from the Montagne de Reims and the Vallée de la Marne (Verzy, Verzenay, Ludes, Ambonnay, Bouzy, Tauxières, Avenay and Aÿ). Then 15% of Meunier from the Montagne de Reims (Ludes) and the Vallée de la Marne (Dizy) brings roundness to this cuvée. \n\nThe uniqueness of the Veuve Clicquot Vintage 2012 stems from the addition of 11% wines aged in large oak casks, bringing strength and aromatic intensity. The Vintage Rosé 2012 blend consists of 13% red still wine, exclusively from the Pinot Noir of Bouzy. The dominance of Pinot Noir and the wooden touch deliver structure and character, a trademark of the Veuve Clicquot style.",
